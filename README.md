# Machine-Learning_CNN

## School Assignment 

[Python Problem]
Given a dataset that consists of car images from five different brands (BMW, Bugatti,
Lamborghini, McLaren, and Volkswagen), your task is to design a neural network using
Tensorflow Keras that can classify those vehicles' images into their corresponding brands.

The dataset is available at
https://app.box.com/shared/static/bgjqppjtnbc8e7258rbnq0ch7fy27tp6.zip.

Key steps:
a) Load the data and then preprocess them with ImageDataGenerator(). (20 marks)

b) Build a convolutional neural network either from scratch or existing models.(20 marks)

c) Train the neural network, evaluate the model prediction, and obtain the evaluation metrics, including prediction accuracy and confusion matrix. (20 marks)

d) Based on error analysis and online materials, suggest a proper direction that can lead to better performance of your model in your presentation document (If you are   referring to any online material, do provide a valid link to that reference). (20 marks)

e) Implement the new direction suggested in d) and demonstrate better evaluation metrics in your prediction outcome. (20 marks)
